    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>So I decided to take another field trip to pick more wild green onions and mugwort 
        to make video recipes with the ingredients. I still have one more video to post 
        from Mexico, but I’ll post it later. In the spring these wild vegetables are soft 
        and tender. Soon they will get tough, and anybody who wants to pick them wild 
        shouldn’t do it too late in the season. My next video will be a soup and snack 
        made with wild grown mugwort. Then the last video that I filmed in Mexico will be 
        released.</p>
